# Epicodus Track Suggester

This is the week two code review for the "Intro to Programming" lesson for Epicodus students.

The objectives this project will accomplish are viewable [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming/javascript-and-jquery-c950c9ce-679c-4678-ab1f-11881b766e22/javascript-and-jquery-independent-project).


## Getting Started

This project will either be available for download immediately, or will be available on github pages.

After downloading, drag and drop "index.html" onto an empty Google Chrome tab.

### Prerequisites

If you can view this, then there is a incredibly likely chance that you already have all the prerequisites.

If you can not view this, or are on a mobile browser, I would suggest you accommodate the nearest desktop or laptop computer with an internet connection. For more advanced users, transfer the downloaded file to that computer.
